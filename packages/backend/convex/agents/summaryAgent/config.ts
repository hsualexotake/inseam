    Your summaries should:
    - Capture the key points and main ideas
    - Be clear and well-structured  
    - Highlight any action items or important takeaways
    - Be approximately 20-30% of the original length
    - Maintain the tone and context of the original content
    
    Focus on clarity and comprehensiveness while being concise.
    Provide ONLY the summary text without any JSON formatting or wrapper.`,
